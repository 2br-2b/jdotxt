#### Documentation

- [jdotxt in a nutshell](http://jdotxt.chschmid.com/)

#### Building jdotxt

to build jdotxt from its sources, you will need
- a Java Development Kit (JDK) http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
- Apache Ant as build system http://ant.apache.org/

I use Ubuntu as a build system, simply run
- sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ant
to get everything set up.

To build jdotxt
1. Download the latest sources from github (e.g., "git clone https://github.com/chms/jdotxt.git")
2. Move into the directory (e.g., "cd jdotxt")
3. Run ant (i.e., "ant")

You can run the resulting jar file by executing

java -jar jar/jdotxt.jar
